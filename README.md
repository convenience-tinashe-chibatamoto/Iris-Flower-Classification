# Iris-Flower-Classification
The Iris Flower Classification task is a classic machine learning problem that involves classifying different species of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements.

The Iris dataset, which is commonly used for this task, contains measurements of the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 iris flowers, with 50 samples from each of the three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.

The goal of the classification task is to train a model that can accurately predict the species of an iris flower given its sepal and petal measurements. This is a supervised learning problem, as the dataset provides the ground truth labels (the species) for each flower.

Despite its simplicity, it still provides valuable insights into the performance of different classification algorithms. In this repo, I emphasize various techniques towards reducing overfitting since the dataset is quite small and even the simplest models can easily learn the underlying patterns in the data and make accurate predictions on new, unseen samples.
